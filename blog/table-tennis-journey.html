            <p><em>From beginner to competitive player – lessons learned on and off the table, and how sports complement research life.</em></p>

            <hr />

            <p>From the quiet rallying sessions with my dad as a child to the intense, sweat-filled matches in university competitions, table tennis has become more than just a game for me—it’s a mirror of my growth, a balance to my research life, and a journey of constant self-discovery.</p>

            <h2>👨‍👧 Where It All Began: Playing with My Dad</h2>
            <p>My first memory of holding a paddle dates back to childhood. My dad wasn’t a professional player, but his passion for the sport lit a spark in me. We used to play in community centers and old tables in the park, where every point was more about laughter than score. What began as playful bonding slowly took shape into something more serious—I started to fall in love with the rhythm of the game, the sharpness of the spin, and the mental clarity it demanded.</p>

            <h2>🏓 Finding a Home at JHUTTC</h2>
            <p>Years later, when I joined Johns Hopkins, I discovered the <strong>JHUTTC (Johns Hopkins University Table Tennis Club)</strong>. I still remember walking into the rec center for the first practice. The sound of smashes, shoes squeaking, and fast-paced rallies immediately drew me in. Everyone played with intensity, but also with a welcoming spirit. They were quick to help me correct my strokes, adjust my footwork, and challenge me with real games.</p>

            <p>That’s when I started to grow—not just as a player, but as a teammate. We drilled together, analyzed matches, celebrated wins, and consoled each other after losses. With every practice session, I improved my technique and mental focus. I learned that in table tennis, as in research, <em>progress doesn’t come from talent alone—it comes from showing up consistently and refining the details</em>.</p>

            <h2>🏆 From Practice to Competition</h2>
            <p>Encouraged by my teammates and coaches, I took the leap to join division-level and regional competitions. The first tournament was nerve-wracking—I remember my hand shaking during the warm-up. But once the match started, everything clicked. The discipline I’d built from practices kicked in, and even when I lost, I gained something far more valuable: resilience.</p>

            <p>Every match became a classroom. I learned to read opponents’ styles, adapt under pressure, and accept defeat with grace. The competitive journey wasn’t just about winning medals (though I’ll admit those are fun!)—it was about learning how to <strong>focus under stress</strong>, <strong>trust my preparation</strong>, and <strong>reset quickly after setbacks</strong>.</p>

            <h2>🔬 How Sports Complement My Research Life</h2>
            <p>As a PhD student, research can often feel isolating, abstract, or mentally draining. But table tennis grounds me. It reminds me to stay agile in thinking, to balance intensity with recovery, and to be present in the moment.</p>

            <p>On the table, the feedback is instant—you know when a stroke is off. In contrast, science moves slower, often requiring months of patience before results emerge. Table tennis offers a refreshing counterbalance: it sharpens my body while resetting my mind.</p>

            <h2>🧠 Takeaways On and Off the Table</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Consistency beats talent</strong>: I wasn’t the most gifted player, but regular practice helped me close the gap.</li>
                <li><strong>Pressure reveals growth</strong>: Competition taught me more than training ever could.</li>
                <li><strong>Team matters</strong>: Having teammates who push, support, and challenge you is invaluable—on the court and in the lab.</li>
                <li><strong>Balance fuels excellence</strong>: Taking care of my physical well-being through sport makes me a better researcher.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Table tennis began as a way to connect with my dad, but over the years, it has become a lifelong passion and a hidden ally in my academic journey. Whether it’s adjusting to a tricky serve or debugging a code in the middle of the night, I’ve found that the same mental agility, discipline, and resilience carry through both arenas.</p>

            <p>I’m grateful for every match, every missed shot, every victory—and most of all, the community that helped shape this journey. Here's to many more rallies ahead!</p>
