## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


* ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on **first-principles simulations and machine learning frameworks for designing stable and efficient 2D thermoelectric materials**, with a focus on Cr-doped Sbâ‚‚Teâ‚ƒ systems.
* ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **machine learning force field (MLFF)** to deepen my expertise in computational materials science.
* ðŸ’¬ Ask me about **Density Functional Theory, ab initio Molecular Dynamics, Boltzmann transport simulations, or building your first research-ready Python workflow**.
