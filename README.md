### 🧠 What I Do

I'm building **first-principles + machine learning frameworks** to accelerate the **discovery and design of stable, efficient 2D thermoelectric materials**, currently focusing on **Cr-doped Sb₂Te₃ systems**. My goal is to bridge *Density Functional Theory (DFT)* with *Data-Driven Modeling*, enabling predictive simulations at scale.
