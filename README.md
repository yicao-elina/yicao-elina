### 🧠 What I Do

I'm building **first-principles + machine learning frameworks** to accelerate the **discovery and design of stable, efficient 2D thermoelectric materials**, currently focusing on **Cr-doped Sb₂Te₃ systems**. My goal is to bridge *Density Functional Theory (DFT)* with *Data-Driven Modeling*, enabling predictive simulations at scale.

---

### 🔍 Research Interests

* 🧮 **DFT + ML integration** for accelerated materials screening
* 🔄 **Machine Learning Force Fields (MLFF)** and interatomic potential fitting
* 💥 **Ab initio Molecular Dynamics (AIMD)** for stability analysis
* ⚡ **Boltzmann Transport + Electron–Phonon Coupling** for thermoelectric performance
* 🛠️ Workflow automation and Python scripting for high-throughput materials informatics
